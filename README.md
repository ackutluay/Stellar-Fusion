# Stellar-Fusion
In this python exercise, the elements and their fusions are studied.
BE.py creates a video describing all the binding energies
&amp; 
stellar fusion.py describes and studies the nuclear fusion for H and He and then calculates the fusion lifetime of the Sun. Also, there will occur a graph without labels, showing the binding energies of all elements, data taken from the mass16abundant.csv 
#Note: This simulation exercise is studied from the github.com/astroDimitrios/Astronomy
